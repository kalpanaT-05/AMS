Attendance-Management-System
=================

The project is meant to create an advanced attendance taking system to help teachers, 
students and college administration by automating the entire process. It is designed keeping 
scalability and code- reusability in mind, which means that the same project can be altered 
by changing few variables to get desired results. Furthermore, thereâ€™s scope of adding more 
functionality without disturbing any of the existing one.
